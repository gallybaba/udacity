    "\n",
    "To visualize data we need to first understand the data, variable names, and how they could link to each other intuitively. Once done, we would plot these data individually and with some other relevant factors with the goal to show inter factor behavior. Next step would be to start asking questions towards the end goal of understanding the dataset. Questions like how some variables interact with others and how that interaction changes data behavior. Also along the lines of how the end result was effected by these variables. Next step would be to combine these findings (answers to these questions) into a story. Once we have a story, we would need to show this presentation to other people to get feedback. Once feedback is gathered, we need to make changes to our story or its presentation based on that feedback. Finally wrap it up with final version of our data exploration and its findings and by then hopefully we would have answered all kinds of questions that were brought up during this process.\n",
